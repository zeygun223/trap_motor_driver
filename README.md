# Mitsuba_M2096-II BLDC Trapezoidal Motor Driver
This project is a **BLDC trapezoidal driver software** developed for the **Mitsuba_M2096-II** motor. The code performs basic trapezoidal commutation based on feedback from Hall sensors.  
## Features
- Trapezoidal commutation  
- Hall sensor support  
- PWM-based speed control  
- Direction control (forward/reverse)
